        Don’t be afraid to ask questions
      </h2>

      <p>
        I know this is probably the most common advice about internships, but
        it’s repeated for a reason. At the start of my internship, I didn’t want
        to bother anyone, so I’d spend hours trying to find answers on my own.
        This led me down several rabbit holes and made tasks take much longer
        than necessary. It took effort (and a bit of courage), but once I
        started asking questions, I became much more productive and got so much
        more out of the experience. Plus, asking questions often led to
        mini-mentorship moments that gave me insights beyond what I could find
        on Google.

        The importance of communication.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Before my internship, I assumed software engineering was mostly solo
        desk work with minimal meetings. But every morning, our software teams
        gathered for daily stand-ups, and attending these opened my eyes to how
        important cross-functional communication is. Sharing progress updates
        and discussing roadblocks with other teams helped us collaborate more
        effectively and keep projects moving forward. I also realized that
        speaking up during these meetings, even if it felt intimidating, was key
        to making progress and letting others know where I needed support.

        Understanding the role of a PM.
      </h2>

      <p>
        During my internship, I had the chance to shadow our team’s Product
        Manager. Watching him run scrum meetings and manage our Kanban board
        helped me understand what the role actually involves—and how it aligns
        with my long-term goals. I saw firsthand how a good PM leads with
        empathy, helps remove roadblocks, and navigates unexpected challenges
        while keeping the team aligned. It was interesting to see how product
        decisions balanced user needs, technical constraints, and business
        goals, and it made me excited about the possibility of stepping into
        that role one day.

        It’s okay not to know everything.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Imposter syndrome can feel intense, especially when you’re surrounded by
        people who have been in industry for years. I learned that internships
        are meant for learning, not proving that you already know everything
        especially in a field like Computer Science that is constantly evolving.
        The better part of my internship involved learning tools and
        technologies that I had never worked with and g The sooner I accepted
        that it was okay to ask for help or admit when I didn’t understand
        something, the faster I could grow and actually enjoy the experience.

      <h2 className="font-semibold text-pink-900 mt-6">Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        Internships are about learning what you want in your future career and
        building your skills. Looking back, I’m grateful for the roadblocks, the
        mentorship opportunities, and the lessons I picked up along the way. My
        first internship is special to me because it gave me a glimpse into what
        a full-time position would look like and gave me a strong foundation for
        my future roles both in school and in the industry. It helped shape the
        direction I want to go in my career and have made me more excited about
        what’s next.

        If you’re starting your first internship soon, remember:{" "}
        <strong>
          it’s okay to ask questions, take initiative, and lean into the
          learning process
        </strong>
        . You’ll get so much more out of the experience that way.

        Can neural networks achieve strong AI? This question sits at the heart
        of debates in cognitive science and philosophy, and thought experiments
        like Searle’s Chinese Room and the Churchlands’ Luminous Room are
        crucial to unpacking this complexity.
      </p>

      <p>
        John Searle argued that according to strong AI, a computer could be
        programmed to have a mind and consciousness, not just simulate
        intelligent behavior but genuinely comprehend the information it
        processes. This contrasts with weak AI, which focuses on using machines
        as tools to study cognitive phenomena without claiming the machines
        themselves are conscious.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neural networks, inspired by the human brain, are computational models
        with interconnected nodes (like neurons) organized into layers. Input
        signals are processed through these weighted connections across input,
        hidden, and output layers, enabling networks to simulate brain-like
        patterns and functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To challenge strong AI, Searle proposed the Chinese Room Experiment:
        imagine a man in a room following a rule book to manipulate Chinese
        characters without understanding their meaning. To the outside world, it
        appears he understands Chinese, but internally, he is only performing
        symbol manipulation. Searle extended this with the Water Pipe Experiment
        in response to the brain simulator argument, asserting that even if a
        system mimics neural firings, it does not imply true understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Searle’s Chinese Gym Experiment further refuted claims that parallel
        processing networks (like neural networks) could achieve understanding.
        Even if multiple individuals act as nodes in a parallel system to
        produce Chinese outputs, none of them truly understand Chinese.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paul and Patricia Churchland’s Luminous Room experiment counters Searle,
        arguing that intuition alone is insufficient to judge whether syntax can
        become semantics. Using an analogy to electromagnetic waves and light,
        they propose that while intuitively we may doubt syntax can produce
        semantics, scientific evidence might reveal otherwise. They argue that
        reverse-engineering the brain using neural networks could lead to a
        system capable of producing consciousness through complex, parallel
        processing.
      </p>

      <p>
        I personally agree with Searle’s position. Neural networks are
        invaluable for advancing weak AI and can simulate intelligent behavior,
        but this does not equate to genuine understanding or consciousness. As
        machine learning models analyze datasets to generate outputs, they do
        not comprehend information in a human-like way and cannot produce
        original thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key aspect of human intelligence is emotion. Even if a machine could
        understand computations it performs, it would still lack human-like
        emotional depth. Drawing on Dreyfus’s theories, I believe that AI lacks
        the “first-person” perspective and context-dependent understanding that
        are core to human cognition.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also disagree with the Churchlands’ argument that syntax alone is
        sufficient for semantics. Their analogy, while thought-provoking, does
        not guarantee that complex neural networks can produce understanding.
        Programs, regardless of architecture, merely execute instructions
        without consciousness or intention.
      </p>

      <p>
        From personal experience, building machine learning models reveals their
        limitations. A waste-sorting model I created once misclassified a cat as
        waste, highlighting how models lack contextual understanding beyond
        programmed tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        While neural networks can replicate certain brain functions and are
        powerful tools for narrow tasks like language processing, they do not
        capture the full spectrum of human intelligence. Many cognitive
        processes remain unexplained, making it unlikely that AI models can
        fully resemble the human brain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thought experiments like Searle’s and the Churchlands’ provide
        invaluable perspectives in understanding the complexity of AI and the
        limitations of neural networks in achieving strong AI. They remind us
        that while neural networks advance weak AI capabilities, achieving
        consciousness and genuine understanding remains far beyond their current
        scope.
